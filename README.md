# Clank---2DGameEngine
Clank is a WIP 2D Game Engine written in C++ and using SDL2 and OpenGL Math Libraries.

![]()
So far it has the following features:
- An entity-component implementation
- Support for 32x32 pixel sprites
- Animations using sprites
- Maps and tiles
- Simple Collisions using an AABB algorithm
- Rendering Text and UI

It works on a Unity-like Entity Component system for game objects and might include LUA scripting to quickly create levels.
